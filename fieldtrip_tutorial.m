% 1) Specify subject ID
subjID = 'SubjectUCI29';

%% Preprocessing of the anatomical MRI

% 2) Import the anatomical MRI into the MATLAB workspace using ft_read_mri
mri = ft_read_mri([subjID '_MR_acpc.nii']); % we used the dcm series


% 3) Determine the native orientation of the anatomical MRI's left-right 
% axis using ft_determine_coordsys.
% CRITICAL STEP To correctly fuse the MRI and CT scans at a later step, 
% accuracy in demarcating the right hemisphere landmark in the following 
% step is important for avoiding an otherwise hard to detect flip of the 
% scan's left and right orientation.
mri = ft_determine_coordsys(mri);

% 4) Align the anatomical MRI to the ACPC coordinate system, a preferred 
% convention for the FreeSurfer operation optionally used in a later step. 
% In this coordinate system, the origin (coordinate [0,0,0]) is at the 
% anterior commissure (AC), the Y-axis runs along the line between the 
% anterior and posterior commissure (PC), and the Z-axis lies in the midline
%  dividing the two cerebral hemispheres. Specify the anterior and posterior
%  commissure, an interhemispheric location along the midline at the top of 
% the brain, and a location in the brain's right hemisphere.
% If the scan was found to have a left-to-right orientation in the previous
%  step, the right hemisphere is identified as the hemisphere having larger 
% values along the left-right axis. Vice versa, in a right-to-left system, 
% the right hemisphere has smaller values along that axis than its left
%  counterpart 
cfg           = [];
cfg.method    = 'interactive';
cfg.coordsys  = 'acpc';
mri_acpc = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri);

% 5) Write the preprocessed anatomical MRI out to file
cfg           = [];
cfg.filename  = [subjID '_MR_acpc'];
cfg.filetype  = 'nifti';
cfg.parameter = 'anatomy';
ft_volumewrite(cfg, mri_acpc);


% 6) Cortical surface extraction with FreeSurfer (Optional)
% Execute FreeSurfer's recon-all functionality from the Linux or 
% MacOS terminal (Windows via VirtualBox), or from the MATLAB command 
% window as below. This set of commands will create a folder named 
% 'freesurfer' in the subject directory, with subdirectories containing a
%  multitude of FreeSurfer-generated files.
% WARNING: FreeSurfer's fully automated segmentation and cortical
% extraction of a T1-weighted MRI can take 10 hours!!!
% 
% Requirements:
%   - Install XQuartz: https://www.xquartz.org/
%   - Install FreeSurfer: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall
% fshome     = '/Users/cedriccannard/Documents/freesurfer';
fshome     = '/Applications/freesurfer/8.1.0';
subdir     = data_path;
mrfile     = subdir;
system(['export FREESURFER_HOME=' fshome '; ' ...
'source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh; ' ...
'mri_convert -c -oc 0 0 0 ' mrfile ' ' [subdir '/tmp.nii'] '; ' ...
'recon-all -i ' [subdir '/tmp.nii'] ' -s ' 'freesurfer' ' -sd ' subdir ' -all'])

% 7) Import the extracted cortical surfaces into the MATLAB workspace and 
% examine their quality. Repeat the following code using rh.pial to visualize
%  the pial surface of the right hemisphere.
pial_lh = ft_read_headshape('freesurfer/surf/lh.pial');
pial_lh.coordsys = 'acpc';
ft_plot_mesh(pial_lh);
lighting gouraud;
camlight

% 8) Import the FreeSurfer-processed MRI into the MATLAB workspace for the 
% purpose of fusing with the CT scan at a later step, and specify the 
% coordinate system to which it was aligned in Step 4.
fsmri_acpc = ft_read_mri('freesurfer/mri/T1.mgz'); % on Windows, use 'SubjectUCI29_MR_acpc.nii'
fsmri_acpc.coordsys = 'acpc';

%% Preprocessing of the anatomical CT

% 9) Import the anatomical CT into the MATLAB workspace. Similar to the MRI,
%  the CT scan comes in the format of a single file with an .img or .nii 
% extension, or a folder containing a series of files with a .dcm or .ima 
% extension
ct = ft_read_mri([subjID '_CT_acpc_f.nii']); % we used the dcm series

% 10) In case this cannot be done on the basis of knowledge of the 
% laterality of electrode implantation, determine the native orientation of
%  the anatomical CT's left- right axis using ft_determine_coordsys, 
% similarly to how it was done with the anatomical MRI in Step 3.
% CRITICAL STEP To correctly fuse the MRI and CT scans at a later step, 
% accuracy in demarcating the right and left preauricular landmark in the 
% following step is important for avoiding an otherwise hard to detect flip 
% of the scan's left and right orientation.
ct = ft_determine_coordsys(ct);


% 11) Align the anatomical CT to the CTF head surface coordinate system by
% specifying the nasion (at the root of the nose), left and right preauricular 
% points (just in front of the ear canals), and an interhemispheric location 
% along the midline at the top of the brain. The CT scan is initially 
% aligned to the CTF head surface coordinate system given that the ACPC 
% coordinate system used for the MRI relies on neuroanatomical landmarks 
% that are not visible in the CT.
cfg           = [];
cfg.method    = 'fiducial'; % 'interactive' 'fiducial'
cfg.coordsys  = 'ctf';
cfg.viewresult= 'yes';
ct_ctf = ft_volumerealign(cfg, ct);


% 12) Automatically convert the CT's coordinate system into an approximation
%  of the ACPC coordinate system, the same system the anatomical MRI was 
% aligned to. The call to ft_hastoolbox ensures that the required SPM 
% toolbox is on the path.
ft_hastoolbox('spm12', 1);
ct_acpc = ft_convert_coordsys(ct_ctf, 'acpc');

%% Fusion of the CT with the MRI

% 13) Fuse the CT with the MRI, a necessary step to link the electrode 
% locations in the anatomical CT to their corresponding locations in the 
% anatomical MRI. Given that both scans are from the same subject and their 
% common denominator is the skull, a rigid body transformation suffices for 
% their alignment under normal circumstances (the default technique when
%  using the SPM-method in FieldTrip).
cfg             = [];
cfg.method      = 'spm';
cfg.spmversion  = 'spm12';
cfg.coordsys    = 'acpc';
cfg.viewresult  = 'yes';
ct_acpc_f = ft_volumerealign(cfg, ct_acpc, fsmri_acpc);

% 14) Carefully examine the interactive figure that is produced after the 
% coregistration is completed, showing the MRI and fused CT superimposed. 
% A successful fusion will show tight interlocking of CT-positive skull (in blue) and MRI-positive brain and skin tissue (in red).
% CRITICAL STEP Accuracy of the fusion operation is important for correctly 
% placing the electrodes in anatomical context in a following step.


% 15) Write the MRI-fused anatomical CT out to file
cfg           = [];
cfg.filename  = [subjID '_CT_acpc_f'];
cfg.filetype  = 'nifti';
cfg.parameter = 'anatomy';
ft_volumewrite(cfg, ct_acpc_f);


%% Electrode placement

% 16) Import the header information from the recording file, if possible. 
% By giving the electrode labels originating from the header as input to 
% ft_electrodeplacement in the next step, the labels will appear as a to-do
%  list during the interactive electrode placement activity. A second 
% benefit is that the electrode locations can be directly assigned to labels
%  collected from the recording file, obviating the need to sort and rename
%  electrodes to match the electrophysiological data.

load([subjID '_hdr.mat']);
hdr = ft_read_header(hdr);
